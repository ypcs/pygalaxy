Wiimote client-server protocol

Server is utility program (daemon) that connects to wiimote,
accepts information requests from client programs.  Pygalaxy
is the client, gets info and passes it along to games.

Client initiates all communication, sends command and gets response
Command is a pair of a text string command and data
format of data (2nd part of pair) depends on command (may be None)
Server response depends on command, may be None

Command Data Response
"INFO" None list, gets info for devices connected
"GET" int list, gets state of one device
"RUMBLE" int*bool None, set rumble on/off for particular device

GET status format:
  tuple of
    button state (list of bool, includes nunchuk buttons)
    accelerometer values (list of float) (normalized with 1 = 1G, xyz)
    nunchuk acc values (list of float) (normalized, xyz)
    joystick values (list of float) (normalized to -1..1, xy)

If no nunchuk, will always have 0.0 for acc and unpressed for buttons.
