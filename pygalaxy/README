This is a PyGame game library designed to make programming simple 2D 
games easier.  It works with keyboard, joystick, mouse, and Wii 
controllers connected on bluetooth.  It has drawing primitives, animated 
sprites, collision detection, music, sound effects, particle systems, 
artificial intelligence and more!

This library is packaged using distutils.  To install from source,
you probably want to do:

sudo python setup.py install

Documentation is available in the doc/ directory.
